description: "Address every unresolved review comment on a GitHub pull request — locate the PR (current branch, PR URL, PR number, or issue number with linked PR), fetch both inline review comments and PR-level issue comments, then for each thread ground the fix in the branch's commits and diff, edit the code, make ONE commit per comment, reply to the thread, and resolve it. Trigger phrases — \"address PR comments\", \"address review comments\", \"fix review feedback\", \"respond to PR review\", \"/address-pr-comments\", \"address the comments on PR #123\", \"handle the review on this branch\". Skip for — opening a new PR (use open-pr), editing a PR description (use `gh pr edit`), responding to PR conversations that aren't review feedback (e.g. CI bot comments), or branches with no open PR."

> **User-question protocol:** Whenever this skill needs the user to pick between options, confirm an action, or answer a multiple-choice prompt, you MUST call the `AskUserQuestion` tool to render a proper interactive picker. Do NOT print numbered options as plain text and wait for the user to type a number — that produces a degraded UX. Free-form questions (open-ended typing) may be asked in prose, but any time you would write "1) … 2) … 3) …", use `AskUserQuestion` instead.


# Address PR Comments

Resolve every reviewer thread on a PR with a per-comment commit, a reply, and a resolved thread. Reviewer ends with zero unresolved threads and a clear audit trail.

---

## Phase 1 — Locate the PR

Determine the target PR from the user's argument or current branch:

```bash
# explicit number/URL provided
gh pr view <number-or-url> --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,url,state,isDraft

# current branch
gh pr view --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,url,state,isDraft

# issue number provided — find linked PR
gh issue view <number> --json closedByPullRequestsReferences
```

**Exit conditions:**
- PR found and `state=OPEN` → continue.
- No PR for current branch → ask the user for a PR number/URL; do not guess.
- PR is `MERGED` or `CLOSED` → stop and ask the user to confirm.

Checkout the PR branch if not already on it: `gh pr checkout <number>`.

---

## Phase 2 — Fetch ALL comments

Two distinct APIs. Run both — missing one means missing comments.

```bash
PR=<number>
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)  # e.g. owner/repo
OWNER=${REPO%/*}
NAME=${REPO#*/}

# Inline (review) comments — anchored to a file/line
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {id, user: .user.login, path, line, body, in_reply_to_id, commit_id, created_at, html_url}'

# PR-level issue comments (top-level conversation, not anchored)
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$PR/comments" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {id, user: .user.login, body, created_at, html_url}'

# Review threads with resolved state (GraphQL — needed to skip already-resolved)
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$pr:Int!){
    repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo){
      pullRequest(number:$pr){
        reviewThreads(first:100){
          nodes{ id isResolved isOutdated comments(first:50){ nodes{ id databaseId body path line author{login} } } }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=$OWNER -f repo=$NAME -F pr=$PR
```

**Build a worklist** of threads where `isResolved=false`. Skip resolved threads. Note `isOutdated=true` threads — the anchor line may have moved; verify before acting.

**Pagination caps**: `reviewThreads(first:100)` truncates at 100 threads, and `comments(first:50)` truncates at 50 per thread. For larger PRs, also request `pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}` and re-query with `after:$cursor` until `hasNextPage=false`. If the first page already returns `hasNextPage=true`, you have not seen all threads — do NOT proceed to Phase 3 with a partial worklist.

---

## Phase 3 — Per-thread loop (fan out to subagents)

For each unresolved thread, in order from oldest to newest, **dispatch the `pr-comment-resolver` subagent** (via `Agent(subagent_type=pr-comment-resolver)`) — one subagent invocation per thread, sequentially. Each subagent isolates the read-edit-commit-reply-resolve work in a fresh context, so the parent's window stays clean as you work through 10+ threads.

**Pass to the subagent** (per invocation):

```
PR_NUMBER: <number>
REPO: <owner/repo>
BASE_REF: <base branch name>

THREAD:
  threadNodeId: <GraphQL node id from Phase 2>
  isOutdated: <bool>
  rootCommentId: <REST id of the first comment — for in_reply_to>
  rootCommentDatabaseId: <database id>
  path: <file path or null>
  line: <line number or null>
  author: <github login>
  body: <comment markdown>
  isInline: <true for file-anchored, false for PR-level>
```

**The subagent's contract** (see `pr-comment-resolver`):
- Read the file at `path:line` (with the branch-local diff context).
- Classify the comment: `change_request` | `question` | `nit` | `stale` | (sub-decision) `declined`.
- If applicable: edit code, commit (one commit per thread), reply via the right gh API surface, resolve the thread (unless declined).
- Return a structured JSON result.

**Why fan out?** Each thread is a self-contained unit (one comment, one diff slice, one fix, one reply). Reading file context for each one accumulates in the parent's window if done inline; isolating per-thread keeps the parent at a constant context size regardless of PR size.

**Why sequential, not parallel?** All threads commit to the same branch. Parallel commits race on `git index.lock` and blow up the one-commit-per-comment audit trail.

After each subagent returns, record its result in a worklist for Phase 4. If the subagent returns `status: "error"`, surface immediately to the user and stop — do not auto-retry.

**Manual fallback** — if for any reason the subagent isn't available or the thread is unusually complex (multi-comment back-and-forth requiring context the agent can't be briefed with), fall back to running the steps inline:

### 3a. Ground the fix
- Read the file at the comment's `path` and `line`.
- Run `git log <base>..HEAD -- <path>` to see what this branch already changed there.
- If the anchor is stale (line shifted, code rewritten), re-read surrounding context and confirm the comment still applies. If it doesn't, note this for the reply (don't silently skip).

### 3b. Before fixing, ask yourself:
- **Is this a change request, a question, or a nit?** Reviewers signal differently — a question may not want code touched at all; a nit may want acknowledgement, not action.
- **What outcome would satisfy the reviewer?** The fix you want to write and the fix they're asking for can diverge — pick theirs, or push back explicitly.
- **Does the question imply a fix?** If a reviewer asks "why not X here?" and X is obviously better, the question IS the change request. If X is a tradeoff, answer the question and let them decide.
- **Is the nit worth a commit?** Trivial → fix. Stylistic preference you disagree with → reply, decline, leave unresolved for them to resolve.

This classification drives whether you fix-and-reply, reply-only, or decline-and-leave-unresolved in 3c–3e.

### 3c. Apply the fix (when needed)
Edit the code. Stay in scope — fix only what this comment is about. Do not opportunistically refactor neighbors.

### 3d. Commit (one per addressed comment)
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "address review: <short summary> (#<thread-id-or-anchor>)"
```
One thread = one commit. If a single reviewer comment legitimately requires changes in multiple files, that's still one commit. If you replied without code changes, no commit.

### 3e. Reply and resolve
Reply to the thread (use `in_reply_to` for inline comments so it threads properly):

```bash
# Inline reply — REST
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments" -f body="<reply text>" -F in_reply_to=<comment-id> -X POST

# Resolve the thread — GraphQL (use the thread node id from Phase 2)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){ resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){ thread{ id isResolved } } }' -f id=<thread-node-id>
```

Reply text:
- **Fixed**: one short sentence on what changed + the commit SHA. Example: `Fixed in abc1234 — extracted to formatUserName().`
- **Question only**: answer it directly.
- **Declined**: explain why briefly; do NOT auto-resolve a declined thread — leave for reviewer.

---

## Phase 4 — Push and verify

Before pushing, run the **canonical residue + secrets sweep** (`agentsystem-core:check-pr-readiness` Phase 5, with `include-working-tree`) on the commits you created this run — a pr-comment fix is still code, and a stray `console.log` or a pasted secret in a "quick fix" ships straight onto the reviewed PR. Hard-block on secret literals and merge-conflict markers; surface the rest to the user. Then:

```bash
git push
```

**If the push is rejected** (non-fast-forward — common after the reviewer rebased main into the PR branch): STOP. Run `git fetch` and report the divergence to the user. Do NOT auto-`--force-with-lease` or auto-rebase — ask the user how they want to reconcile. Force-pushing during an active review can drop reviewer commits or invalidate review state.

Then verify zero unresolved, non-declined threads remain:

Re-run the Phase 2 `reviewThreads` GraphQL query and assert that every thread node has `isResolved=true` OR is on the declined-list reported above. Any other unresolved thread means a comment was missed — return to Phase 3 for it.

Report to the user: number of threads addressed, number of commits made, number of replies sent, and any threads left intentionally unresolved (declined nits) with rationale.

---

## NEVER

- **NEVER bundle multiple comment fixes into one commit**
  **Instead:** One commit per addressed comment, even if commits touch the same file. Use the comment's gist in the subject.
  **Why:** The user picked one-commit-per-comment so reviewers can map each commit back to the thread that drove it. A combined commit destroys that audit trail.

- **NEVER reply without resolving (when you fixed it) or resolve without replying**
  **Instead:** Fix → commit → reply with the commit SHA → resolve. All four, in that order.
  **Why:** A resolved-but-silent thread reads as dismissive; a replied-but-unresolved thread leaves the reviewer wondering if you're still working on it.

- **NEVER act on a thread without checking it's still unresolved**
  **Instead:** Use the GraphQL `reviewThreads.isResolved` field from Phase 2; skip resolved threads entirely.
  **Why:** Re-fixing already-resolved comments creates noise commits and confuses the reviewer about what changed since their last pass.

- **NEVER skip the inline-comments API and rely on `gh pr view`**
  **Instead:** Hit both `pulls/:n/comments` (inline) AND `issues/:n/comments` (top-level). `gh pr view --comments` shows only the latter.
  **Why:** Inline review comments are the bulk of review feedback and live on a different endpoint. Missing them means addressing a fraction of the review.

- **NEVER auto-resolve a thread you declined**
  **Instead:** Reply with the rationale and leave `isResolved=false` for the reviewer to resolve.
  **Why:** Some teams treat thread resolution as the reviewer's signal of acceptance. Self-resolving a decline overrides that signal and erodes trust.

- **NEVER opportunistically edit unrelated code while in the file**
  **Instead:** Stay in the scope of the comment. If you spot something else, mention it in the report at the end.
  **Why:** Drive-by edits inflate the per-comment commit, hide unrelated changes from review, and break the one-commit-per-comment promise.

- **NEVER act on stale/outdated thread anchors without verifying the comment still applies**
  **Instead:** Re-read the current code at that path. If the concern is no longer relevant, reply explaining and resolve. If it's moved, address it at the new location.
  **Why:** After rebases or earlier fixes, an anchor can point to code that no longer matches what the reviewer was critiquing — fixing the new code is a non-sequitur.

## Post-step: /simplify

After all comment commits land, run `agentsystem-core:simplify` against the cumulative diff to catch duplication or smell drift introduced across the per-comment fixes.
